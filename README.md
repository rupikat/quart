1.CONCEPTUAL APPROACH:
  At first, the target variable is dichotomous and there is no description about the variables and also there are more NaN values in the data set.So ,for identifing the correlation between the variables and filling the NaN's with sutiable values , I had choosen the Logistic Regression model.Scine the model is unbiased, and also with the help of sensitivity ,specificity, ROC curve and Confusion matrix ,we can validate and do futher process for imporving reliability.
